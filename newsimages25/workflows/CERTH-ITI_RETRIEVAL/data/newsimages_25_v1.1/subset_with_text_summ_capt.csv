Despite the decline, inflation is still running far higher than the Bank of England’s target rate of 2%. As a result, the central bank is expected to raise its main interest rate further at its upcoming meeting in early August.

Although Dave Ramsden, deputy governor at the Bank of England, said inflation is still “much too high,” analysts said the bigger-than-expected fall may mean the bank only raises the main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage to 5.25% rather than a half-point.

Financial markets now think the peak will be below 6%, evident in the 1.1% decline in the British pound to $1.29 — a lower potential return puts downward pressure on a currency.

“The positive surprise to headline inflation in June takes significant pressure off the bank to go big again,” said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank.

That may provide homeowners who are looking to get a new mortgage deal some comfort, if the sharp upward pressure on mortgage rates starts to decline. Unlike in the U.S., most homeowners lock in mortgage deals for only a few years, so they face the prospect of higher borrowing costs if interest rates ratchet up sharply, as they have in the U.K.

The Bank of England, like other central banks around the world, has been raising interest rates over the past 18 months or so, firstly as a result of supply chain problems linked to the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led to a sharp rise in energy and food prices in particular.

However, inflation in the U.K. has proved stickier than in other wealthy nations within the Group of Seven for a number of reasons.

Many economists blame Britain’s departure from the European Union as one reason for impeded trade. Others blame the Bank of England for being too slow in raising interest rates, which help dampen down inflation by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow.

“The U.K. still has one of the highest inflation rates of any advanced economy, but after today it merely looks bad rather than a basket case,” said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation.

Though inflation is clearly heading down from its double-digit peak in late 2022, it is still a long way from the U.K. government’s target to halve inflation to around 5% by the end of the year.

“Inflation is falling and stands at its lowest level since last March, but we aren’t complacent and know that high prices are still a huge worry for families and businesses,” Treasury chief, Jeremy Hunt, said after the figures were released.","The Bank of England has seen a sharp decline in inflation, but the central bank is expected to raise interest rates further to combat high inflation.","A picture of a person holding a large shopping basket with a red ""X"" marked through it, symbolizing the reduction of prices and the impact on inflation."

In honor of this major accomplishment, Kishimoto returned to the franchise to both write and draw a flashback special that showed some major moments in the Fourth Hokage’s life. Now, the new special went into detail about how the Rasengan originally came to be and explained the inspiration for the attack that became a trademark of Minato, Naruto, and Boruto.

Warning. If you haven’t read the new special, “Naruto: The Whorl Within The Spiral” be forewarned that we’ll be diving into serious spoiler territory. As Jiraiya and Minato learned that threats facing Konoha would grow bigger, the future Fourth Hokage came to the realization that he would need to develop new powerful Jutsus to keep up. In training with his mentor, Minato found himself attempting to control his chakra in a fashion that would “knead it” into what would become the Rasengan. Jiraiya laid out what would be necessary in creating the ultimate attack.

“It’s either a dud or discharges early. It just isn’t stable. I’ve heard that when you knead chakra, it helps to match rotations with the direction of the whorl of your hair. I always visualize kneading chakra in a clockwise direction and my whorl twists right.”

Based on a folklore tale, Jiraiya reveals that Minato’s hair unfortunately has two whorls, meaning that it would be quite difficult in creating a Rasengan. Following this unfortunate discovery, the “Yellow Flash” took a different approach in creating the Rasengan, realizing that he would need to “knead chakra equally in both directions”. This tactic worked with flying characters, as Minato created his first Rasengan but unfortunately named it “Ice Pop-Inspired Nimbus Jiraiya Twin Whorl Sphere”. Luckily, this name didn’t catch on.

Ultimately, Minato was able to master the technique and this chapter set the stage for his relationship with Kushina, eventually leading to the birth of Naruto. While creator Masashi Kishimoto won’t be returning to artistic duties on Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, the mangaka is still in the driver’s seat when it comes to the shonen franchise’s writing. Hopefully, Kishimoto will return to the earlier days of Konoha as there are many years of stories that have yet to be told.","The Fourth Hokage, Minato, learns to control his chakra and creates the Rasengan, a powerful Jutsu that becomes a trademark of the character.","A close-up of Minato's face, looking determined and focused, with his hair twisted in a way that resembles a whorl."

(HOUSTON) — Five plaintiffs began the first day of testimony Wednesday as part of a lawsuit filed against the state of Texas, saying the state’s abortion bans put their lives in jeopardy.

The women are some of the 15 individuals party to the lawsuit who have alleged they were denied lifesaving emergency care due to Texas’ abortion laws.

Lawyers representing the women are seeking a preliminary injunction on Texas’ abortion laws that would allow for lifesaving abortions. They are asking the court to provide a “remedy applied to patients whose life, health or fertility is at risk from an emergent medical condition,” Molly Duane, a lead attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said during opening statements Wednesday.

“Tens of thousands of Texans have already been denied abortions. By any measure, Texas is in a health care crisis. The only issue in this case, however, is who should be getting abortions, under the medical exception to the abortion ban and two years later, still, no one knows,” Duane said.

“In the words of the state’s own expert, it is ‘the blind leading the blind on the ground,'” Duane said.

Prosecutors appearing on behalf of the state of Texas claimed the suit was due to dissatisfaction with medical care that the plaintiffs received and that they did not approve of Texas laws.

“Plaintiffs simply do not like Texas’ restrictions on abortion,” Cindy Fletcher, a representative for the state in the lawsuit, said.

Plaintiffs testifying at the hearings include Amanda Zurawski, who developed sepsis and nearly died after being refused an abortion when her water broke at 18 weeks; Ashley Brandt, who was forced to leave the state for abortion care after one of the twins she was carrying was diagnosed with a fatal condition; Samantha Casiano, who was forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy to term and give birth to a baby who died four hours later; Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN who had to travel out of state to receive abortion care for a nonviable pregnancy; and Dr. Damla Karsan, a Houston-based OB-GYN representing her patients.

Amanda Zurawski

In her testimony Wednesday, Zurawski said she went into sepsis after doctors said they could not induce labor because her fetus still had a heartbeat. Zurawski said she was told she had an incompetent cervix, premature dilation of her cervix, and would miscarry.

Her water broke later that evening but she did not miscarry until three days later, she said.

“I went from feeling physically OK to shaking uncontrollably. I was freezing cold even though it was 110 degrees out. My teeth were chattering violently. I couldn’t get a sentence out. My husband Josh asked me how I was feeling on a scale from 1 to 10. I didn’t know the difference between 1 and 10 — which one was higher,” Zurawski said.

“[I was] completely devastated. I’d just been given the worst news of my life, and I was terrified because I didn’t know what was going to happen. Again, this was my first pregnancy. I didn’t know what labor would be like, I didn’t know if I would go into labor. I didn’t know if I’d get sick. It was terrifying,” Zurawski said.

She said she suffered two bouts of sepsis and one of her fallopian tubes has since been permanently closed. Zurawski also needed several procedures to remove scar tissue and reconstruct her uterus after it collapsed.

“I felt like I’d been hit by a truck. It felt like the worst flu I had ever had in my life. I was so sore. Every muscle in my body was so sore that I couldn’t sit up without assistance. I couldn’t roll over. I actually lost control of my bowels and soiled the bed multiple times, which was absolutely humiliating,” Zurawski said.

Zurawski said she did not feel comfortable traveling to receive care elsewhere.

“We looked into it briefly but we quickly learned that I would either have to drive at least eight hours to get to a state where they could provide an abortion or we would have to fly and we didn’t feel like that would be safe, especially since the physician had advised that we not be more than 15 to 20 minutes from a hospital,” Zurawski said during her testimony.

Zurawski — who has done three egg retrievals since going into sepsis — said she still wants to have children and is having difficulty getting pregnant due to complications from developing sepsis.

Ashley Brandt

Ashley Brandt testified she was forced to leave the state for abortion care after one of the twins she was carrying was diagnosed with a fatal condition.

Brandt said that she traveled to Denver to receive a selective fetal reduction after one of her twins was diagnosed with a fatal condition called acrania — its skull had not fused and it left the baby’s brain and tissue exposed to the amniotic fluid.

The procedure aborts one of the two pregnancies to give the other fetus the best chance at survival.

Brandt said she was advised to stay in Colorado for two weeks after the procedure but that wasn’t doable so the couple traveled home just one day later. After returning to Texas, she had some bleeding but was initially hesitant to head to a hospital because she received a procedure that was illegal in Texas.

“I didn’t want anyone to get in trouble and I didn’t want to get in trouble. So it seems silly now but that’s what was holding me back from going. But we eventually did,” Brandt said.

Brandt detailed what she would have had to go through if she had not received care in Colorado

“If I had not gone out of state and had just done what was legal in Texas, my daughter Marley would most likely be in the NICU because she would have been born before 37 weeks. All my ultrasounds up to labor I would have had to watch twin A deteriorate more and more every week,” Brandt said.

“I would have had to give birth to an identical version of my daughter without a skull and without a brain and hold her until she died. Then I would have had to submit a death certificate and plan a funeral and decide if I wanted to bury her or cremate her. It just would have been heartbreaking. But instead I got to just give birth to my healthy daughter,” Brandt said in tears.

“Instead of crying from heartbreak that day, I was crying tears of joy and relief,” Brandt said.

Brandt said her husband had a vasectomy after her daughter was born and that the couple does not plan to have more children out of fear. In her testimony, Brandt said that the couple had always wanted to have three children and were elated when they found out she was pregnant with twins, before receiving the fatal diagnosis for one of the twins.

“I don’t feel safe to have children in Texas anymore. I know that it was very clear that my health didn’t really matter, that my daughter’s health didn’t really matter, which was really heartbreaking,” Brandt said.

Samantha Casiano

Casiano said she was forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy to term only to watch her baby die four hours after giving birth. Casiano’s fetus was diagnosed with anencephaly, a birth defect where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull.

She described the shock of receiving the news at an ultrasound appointment she had gone to alone.

“I felt cold. I was hurt. I wished that I was dreaming. I know wasn’t. I just felt lost,” Casiano said, in tearful testimony.

After finding out her baby’s diagnosis, Casiano met with her obstetrician who did not offer her abortion care.

“She told me that my daughter had been diagnosed with anencephaly — I believe that means that her skull and her brain is not full developed — and that she was sorry, I didn’t have any options,” Casiano said.

“She then called in a caseworker. The caseworker came in and they handed me a paper that said funeral homes on top of it,” Casiano said through tears.

Casiano said her doctor prescribed her with antidepressants, but nothing else.

“I felt like I was abandoned. I felt like I didn’t know how to deal with this situation,” Casiano said. “This was just supposed to be a scan day. I was supposed to know what I’m going to have and it just escalated to me finding out that my daughter was gonna die inside or outside of my womb.”

After leaving her appointment, Casiano said she looked into traveling to get abortion care elsewhere but the family was having car trouble and needed to care for her other children. She said she then “became scared” of getting into trouble for traveling for care or getting someone else into trouble if they helped her do so.

“I couldn’t do it alone. I was scared and I have children and I thought, ‘I can’t go to jail. I can’t get this fine. How would I pay for that? I could lose my job.’ It felt like I had no options,” Casiano said.

Casiano, crying throughout her testimony, got sick when she was asked what concerns she had for herself while continuing her pregnancy after receiving the diagnosis and the judge called a recess.

Texas’ abortion bans

The suit alleged that Texas’ abortion bans have denied the plaintiffs and countless other pregnant people necessary and potentially lifesaving medical care because physicians in the state fear liability, according to the suit.

Texas has several abortion laws in place, prohibiting all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, except in medical emergencies, which the laws do not define. One of the bans — called SB 8 — prohibits abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which kept several plaintiffs from accessing care despite their pregnancies being nonviable, according to the suit.

Under Texas’ bans, it is a second-degree felony to perform or attempt an abortion, punishable by up to life in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. The law also allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion.

The suit is the first to be filed by women impacted by the abortion bans since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, ending federal protections for abortion rights.

The lawsuit is filed against the state of Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton — who was recently impeached — and the Texas Medical Board. A date has not yet been set for a hearing, according to Duane.

Following years of discussions by scientists on how and when humans began to significantly alter the planet, Canada’s Crawford Lake has been chosen to mark the beginning of a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene.

The International Union of Geological Sciences had to select one site that symbolized humans’ enormous effect on Earth before the new era could be officially declared, reported Yale Environment 360.

Each year, particles collect on the tranquil, 79-foot-deep lake and settle to the bottom to form strata of sediment that become a record of the environmental conditions of that time, much like tree rings, according to the journal Nature. If the scientists’ choice is approved, a core of sediment from the lake — located in a conservation area in Ontario — will become the “golden spike” to mark the start of the Anthropocene.

“The sediments found at the bottom of Crawford Lake provide an exquisite record of recent environmental change over the last millennia,” said Simon Turner, a researcher at University College London, in a statement. “It is this ability to precisely record and store this information as a geological archive that can be matched to historical global environmental changes which make sites such as Crawford Lake so important.”

Sediments on the lake’s bottom include evidence of Indigenous Peoples, European settlers, ash from the burning of fossil fuels, nitrates from chemical fertilizers, logging and radioactive plutonium-239 from the testing of nuclear weapons, according to Yale E360, Nature and The Guardian.

“[T]here are no burrowing organisms to disturb the sediments, allowing the precise calendar age of sediments to be determined by layer counting, just like tree rings,” Francine McCarthy, a scientist at Brock University in Ontario, told Yale E360.

Other locations in the running for the origin of the golden spike included a Gulf of Mexico coral reef, a Polish peat bog and the Antarctic ice sheet.

In 2016, the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) decided that humans had had such an impact on the planet that it was time for a new geological epoch, The Guardian reported.

The current geological epoch, the Holocene, began 11,700 years ago, following the last big Ice Age. All of human civilization developed during the Holocene, which was marked by global environmental stability, allowing many plant and animal species to flourish.

If Crawford Lake is approved as the site of the beginning of the Anthropocene, the new geological epoch will officially be declared in August of 2024.

Hallmarks of the Anthropocene include climate change, plastics pollution and devastating impacts on wildlife.

Plutonium isotopes from hydrogen bomb tests have been selected by the AWG as the main marker of the new epoch. The isotopes were spread around the world beginning in 1952, then decreased quickly following the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

“The Anthropocene that starts in the 1950s represents a very rapid change that we have caused to the planet. There’s hope in that respect. The combined impacts of humanity can be changed rapidly for good and for bad. It’s not inevitable that we have to slide into continuing environmental poverty,” said AWG Chair Professor Colin Waters from the University of Leicester, as reported by The Guardian.","The International Union of Geological Sciences has chosen Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch caused by human activities.","Aerial view of Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada, with a team of scientists from Carleton University and Brock University collecting sediment layer samples from the lake bottom."

New York CNN —

“Forrest Gump” has never made a single penny for the studio that made it, despite selling over $300 million worth of tickets at the box office. “Return of the Jedi” was a similarly monumental financial flop. Same goes for at least one Harry Potter film. All of them wildly popular, yet wildly unprofitable. At least on paper.

At the heart of the biggest TV and film industry strike in more than 60 years is a dispute over how people should be paid. But the unique accounting standards that the industry has long relied on to make those calculations is anything but straightforward.

“Hollywood accounting,” as a concept, is so specific to the entertainment business it has its own Wikipedia page.

Accountants talk about Hollywood accounting like a kind of wayward cousin, partly because it diverges from the United States’ generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP — the standard bookkeeping that most US companies adhere to.

And while experts say this kind of creative accounting is perfectly legal, the tactics involve some of the most fantastical fictions ever devised in Tinseltown.

“There are a lot of different tricks,” said Stephen Glaeser, an associate professor of accounting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But the most basic version of Hollywood accounting goes like this:

A studio sets up a subsidiary for each movie it wants to make, and agrees to pay the actors based on that subsidiary’s profits.

To actually make the movie, the subsidiary inevitably takes on expenses — crew wages, craft services, set design, props etc.

When the movie comes out, the subsidiary brings in revenue from ticket sales.

Like in any business, the studio takes the revenue, subtracts the costs, et voilà, there’s your profit (or loss).

This is where it gets weird.

If the movie-making subsidiary makes a profit, the studio then charges the subsidiary — as in, the little company the big company owns, operates, and entirely controls — fees for distribution, advertising, and whatever else, Glaeser told me. And, of course, the subsidiary “agrees” to the new fees. Because it must.

The profits then go straight to the studio in the form of fee payments, so that, on paper, the subsidiary never makes any profit.

But that feels a little absurd, doesn’t it? Why would a red-blooded American corporation not be interested in making a profit?

Because actors and other creatives involved in making it have profit-sharing deals in their contracts. If there’s no profit, the studios don’t have to pay them out.

“This is why the advice is ‘take the gross,’” Glaeser said, echoing what any decent entertainment lawyer tells their client before signing on to a movie or series.

In other words, it’s on actors and writers to make sure any profit-sharing deals are tied to revenue or ticket sales, rather than net profit. No matter how successful the movie is, net profit may, by design, never exist.

Again, that’s all legal.

Where Hollywood accounting distinguishes itself from the kind of financial record-keeping most businesses engage in is the studios’ “overhead allocations,” or general operating expenses, said Bridget Stomberg, an accounting professor at Indiana University Bloomington.

“Some people suspect the overhead allocations to any one movie can be arbitrary and excessive with the goal of making movies look unprofitable,” she said.

But is it ethical?

“‘Ethical’ is not the word I would use,” Glaeser said. “I think studios that use these tricks are acting unethically, and maybe even foolishly. It seems like squeezing some extra profit out of one movie is not worth alienating some of your most important employees and contractors.”

Here come the Men in Black

Once a film is made, there are all kinds of expenses — distributing it widely to theaters, paid TV channels, streaming services, airlines, etc. There are also huge marketing costs and interest payments on debt, said S. Mark Young, an accounting professor at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.

“These costs add up quickly and often swamp the revenues from the film, resulting in zero profits or losses,” Young said. “What the studio is doing is within their purview … but certainly, there seems to be motivation on the part of some studios to reduce profits as much as possible.”

One oft-cited example is the 1997 hit “Men In Black,” starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The movie grossed nearly $600 million on a budget of just $90 million. It was such a box-office winner, the movie spawned three sequels.

And yet Sony Pictures, the studio behind it, claims the film has never broken even.

The movie’s screenwriter, Ed Solomon, has spoken out about the accounting shenanigans that make that possible.

“The studios ARE losing money, just as they say,” he said recently in a deeply sarcastic tweet. “My recent Men in Black profit statement proves that the film, though having generated over $595 million in revenue, has actually *cost* Sony over $598 million. SO close, too: off by just .02%/yr.”

Sony, Solomon says, is artificially keeping the movie in the red to avoid big payouts.

“I think the profit statement is actually better science fiction than the film itself,” he joked in a 2019 tweet.

Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.

I asked Stomberg whether studios would have reasons for keeping their overhead costs inflated other than avoiding paying actors and writers.

“I can’t think of any other motivation,” she said in an email. “If these subsidiaries are US incorporated and are 100%-owned by the same company, there wouldn’t generally be any tax savings.”

Transactions between the studio and its subsidiary, she said, are generally eliminated when companies consolidate their earnings. That means all of these “creative” expense allocations shouldn’t affect what net profits the studio’s shareholders see.

New research revealed a link between alcohol dependence during adolescence and the risk of depression in young adulthood. Based on the analysis, the severity of alcohol dependence at age 18 was more relevant in predicting depression than the rate at which alcohol dependence changed over time.1

Approximately 90,000 people each year in the US experience alcohol abuse.2 This study aimed to expand the understanding surrounding the relationship between alcohol use and the development of depression, which remains a subject in need of further investigation.1

Gemma Hammerton, PhD, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, and investigators conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether alcohol dependence during adolescence heightened the risk of depression in young adulthood. The team focused on adolescents born to women recruited to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children in Avon, UK.

The study involved 3902 adolescents with 58% of the population being female and 42% being male. The majority of participants (96.7%) were of white ethnicity. Data on alcohol dependence and consumption were collected at various ages, specifically around 16, 18, 19, 21, and 23 years, using the self-reported Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.

Additionally, data corresponding to DSM-IV symptoms were gathered around ages 18, 21, and 23 years. The primary outcome was depression at age 24, assessed with the Clinical Interview Schedule Revised.

The findings exhibited associations between alcohol dependence, depression, and alcohol consumption. When assessing the relationship between alcohol dependence at 18 years of age and depression at 24 years, investigators observed a positive link (0.13 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.25, P = 0.019) suggesting alcohol dependence during adolescence could potentially increase the risk of depression in young adulthood.

However, when examining the rate of change in alcohol dependence and its association with depression, the team found no significant association (0.10 [95% CI, -0.82 to 1.01, P = 0.84).

“Our findings therefore suggest that high frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption might not increase the risk of depression during young adulthood unless there are also features of dependency involved,” investigators wrote. “We found no evidence that a faster increase in levels of dependence across adolescence was associated with depression at age 24 years, and only small variability in rate of change over time.”

Regarding alcohol consumption, the latent intercept probit coefficient was -0.01 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.03, P = 0.60), and the linear slope coefficient was 0.01 (95% CI, -0.40 to 0.42, P = 0.96) indiciating no meaningful association between the frequency or quantity of alcohol consumption during adolescence and the risk of depression in young adulthood.

“This finding suggests that the magnitude of the association between dependence and depression is fairly constant over adolescence and that the timepoint for considering levels of alcohol dependence (between ages 16 and 23 years) might not be particularly important,” the team continued. “Few studies have tested the hypothesis that alcohol dependence, but not consumption, during adolescence increases the risk of depression during young adulthood.”

The “Sally Army” major whose village decision made him money.

After 40 years working for the Salvation Army around New Zealand, Anthony and Gaynor Stone’s home at Roseland Park Village was the first they’d ever owned.

The couple bought their villa at the Hamilton East retirement community, part of the Karaka Pines Villages family, in 2015 when it was brand new. Moving there was Gaynor’s idea, Anthony says – he was not originally keen on living in a retirement village.

But once they settled into the 54-home community and began to make friends, the retired Salvation Army major quickly felt at home. He became the chair of the Residents Committee and the couple took part in village activities and social events. As an avowed hater of gardening and lawn-mowing, he was very happy to leave those jobs to a caretaker.

“We’ve been very happy here,” he says. “It’s been a wonderful experience.” However, aside from the multiple benefits of a retirement community run by Karaka Pines, he also gained something that doesn’t occur in many of the alternatives in New Zealand: greater financial freedom.

Most retirement village business models keep the capital gains on the properties and dish out pre-agreed allotments to residents. Karaka Pines Villages is one of the few where residents retain the capital gains on their properties, a model in place since 2010.

This has turned out to have a huge impact on Anthony’s life. Sadly, Gaynor passed away in April last year. After experiencing some health issues himself, Anthony is selling their three-bedroom Roseland Park home and moving to an apartment in a different village so he can access more day-to-day support, as well as tiered care should he need extra help in the future.

With the value of his home nearly doubling in eight years, he is leaving with more options to take care of his future needs. Karaka Pines’ capital gains promise has given him, he says, greater financial freedom than if they’d bought into a traditional retirement village: “The capital gains are a huge benefit and it’s allowing me to make this move to a place with a higher level of care with some change to invest, to help me on a day-to-day basis.”

It wasn’t what they had planned for their retirement. When Gaynor died, Anthony felt as though he’d “lost my right arm”. The pair had been inseparable for most of their lives. They were married for 51 years and worked for the Salvation Army together every day while raising three sons.

“I feel like part of me is not here, so it’s been a really tough time for me,” he says. Gaynor suffered from dementia in her last year and Anthony became her main carer until she needed hospital-level care and he was able to return to “just being her husband again”.

He found the support of his family, neighbours, and village staff invaluable during this difficult time. With understanding staff and residents, he was able to remain independent in Roseland Park for as long as possible.

“There were always people from the village popping in and out to see how I was,” he says. “Before I moved in, I thought we’d all be living in each other’s pockets but it’s not like that. You just know people are there if you need them.”

He also found that staff went “above and beyond” in keeping an eye on him: “The management have also been extremely kind and helpful,” he says, recalling one particularly difficult day after Gaynor died.

“I was a complete mess, physically and emotionally wrecked,” he says. “The village manager came over and asked if I was okay. I said ‘No I’m not; I feel terrible and like I’m going to keel over; I don’t think I can walk from here to the car’.”

The manager got her own car, took him to the doctor, visited with him, and then accompanied him to the pharmacy as well.

“She must have been two hours with me; she just wanted to help,” he says. “That’s been my experience of this village. It’s been a nice place to be.”

He says Roseland Park felt more like a gated community than a retirement village, and he enjoyed that the place “didn’t feel corporate … it was just a comfortable, secure way of living”.

The memories make him sad to leave Roseland Park, but the financial security he has preserved with the capital gains promise means he has no regrets.

“This was the first home we’d bought, so it’s got that emotional attachment,” he says. “It’s been a wonderful experience for us, and I still feel Gaynor around from time to time. I miss her terribly, but life needs to go on.”","A retired Salvation Army major is selling his home in a retirement village to access more day-to-day support and care, thanks to a capital gains promise.","A photo of a retirement village home with a garden, showing the beauty of the surrounding landscape."

But what happens after rangers seize illegally harvested animals?

In the beginning on July, an Environmental Conservation Officer (ECO) caught a family using an illegal net while fishing in the town of Clarence, NY. The 107 animals that were subsequently confiscated were about to go on a wild journey.

Illegal Use of Fishing Net in Clarence, NY

The case in Clarence, NY was just one of many examples of a New York hunter or fisher allegedly skirting the rules for their own benefit. In this particular case, the accused parties not only reportedly harvested too many fish, but shared that they were illegally using a net to fish (below) because their child ""couldn’t catch anything with a fishing pole"". Luckily, the fish wouldn't go to waste.

What Happens to Confiscated Fish in New York?

After the NYS DEC shared photos of the confiscated fish, the same question came pouring in. ""What happens to the fish? Are they cleaned and donated to a food pantry, or just thrown away?"", asked one curious commenter. ""I never did understand why they pose with the dead fish... I mean what are they gonna do with them?? At least the other guy was gonna eat them!"", said another. The NYS DEC's answer was a surprise to many.

Where NYS DEC Donates Confiscated Fish

The NYS DEC shared that in this particular case, the fish were headed to an animal sanctuary. ""They were donated to Messinger Woods Wildlife Care and Education Center to provide the eagles with a tasty treat"", they reported. This wasn't the only instance of confiscated seafood being donated.

In January of 2023, the NYS DEC shared that they had seized numerous ""undersized"" lobsters that were allegedly being sold at several New York supermarkets. Over 300 lobsters were eventually taken and donated to local food shelters in the area. In March of 2023, NY DEC officers fed illegally-harvested bass to animals at the Trevor Zoo in Millbrook, NY.

Eliyahu “Eli” Weinstein, 48, of Lakewood, who is also known as Mike Konig, is among five men accused of defrauding dozens of investors out of $35 million, according to an arrest complaint unsealed in federal court in Trenton. The five are charged with wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to obstruct justice, and each could face up to 25 years in prison.

Philip Sellinger, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said Weinstein used a fake name and falsely promised access to deals involving scarce medical supplies, baby formula and first-aid kits supposedly destined for wartime Ukraine.

“These were brazen and sophisticated crimes that involved multiple conspirators and drew right from Weinstein’s playbook of fraud,” Sellinger said.

Weinstein, Aryeh “Ari” Bromberg, 49, of Lakewood, and Shlomo Erez, 55, a citizen and resident of Israel, were due to make their initial court appearances Wednesday. Two others — Joel Wittels, 57, of Lakewood, and Alaa Hattab, 34, of Otttawa, Canada — remain at large. It wasn’t known if they have retained attorneys.

Weinstein was convicted two times in New Jersey federal court for defrauding investors. The first case involved a real estate Ponzi scheme, and the second stemmed from additional fraud he committed while on pretrial release.

For those crimes, which resulted in combined losses to investors of approximately $230 million, Weinstein was sentenced to 24 years in prison. On Jan. 19, 2021, the day before leaving office, then-President Trump commuted Weinstein’s term to time served after less than eight years into his sentence.

Shortly after he was released, Weinstein began orchestrating a new scheme to solicit money from investors through a company called Optimus Investments Inc., according to court documents. Using a fake name, he allegedly ran the firm with Bromberg and Wittels, with Weinstein’s true name and identity kept hidden because, as he acknowledged in a secretly recorded conversation, investors wouldn’t give them “a penny” if they learned of his involvement.

Weinstein, Bromberg, and Wittels received the bulk of investor money through a second company, Tryon Management Group LLC, which was owned and controlled by two other conspirators, according to the documents. Tryon promised these individual investors — consisting mostly of friends and family — lucrative opportunities to invest in deals, and the money they gave to Tryon was transferred to Weinstein through Optimus.

In February 2022, almost immediately after Tryon and Optimus started receiving investor money, Tryon was unable to pay its investors. Weinstein, Bromberg, and Wittels allegedly agreed with Tryon’s owners to pool money from existing investors of both Optimus and Tryon and use it to make monthly payments to other investors in a Ponzi-like fashion. Bromberg, Wittels and the Tryon owners falsely told investors the payments derived from legitimate investment returns, the documents say.

In late August 2022, Weinstein revealed his true identity to the Tryon owners in a secretly recorded meeting, according to the documents. In another recorded meeting the same month, he acknowledged misappropriating Tryon investor money and making various false statements about the purported Optimus deals, saying, “I finagled and Ponzied and lied to people to cover us.”","A New Jersey man, Eliyahu “Eli” Weinstein, is accused of fraud for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme through a fake company called Optimus Investments Inc.","A photo of a fake company logo with a red X marked through it, symbolizing the alleged Ponzi scheme."

At State and Main streets, century-old water lines are being upgraded, and sidewalks and pavement are getting a new look.

But all that work is causing some headaches.

While some people say the street reconstruction project is sorely needed, others can’t wait for the project to be completed. It’s had a huge impact on local businesses and the people who work in the area.

Alvin Moore works downtown and he has to deal with the construction on a regular basis.

“I say on a scale of one to 10, probably about an eight,” says Moore.

That’s how Moore rates the inconvenience.

Reconstruction work on State Street stretches only 1,500 feet, but the never ending noise at the unpaved construction site has tremendously cut down foot traffic in the area.

“It’s hard to get to different businesses and stuff down here, and actually get to work,” says Moore. “I have to kind of detour and go the opposite way than I normally would go.”

With many avoiding the area, businesses like the Holiday Inn are struggling.

The hotel’s general manager would not talk on camera but confirms that the hotel in the heart of downtown is losing business. In some cases customers cut their visits short or switch to a different hotel.

Melvin Scott says the street project is a blessing and a curse.

“You have to find solace in the long game, and for fixing up the roads,” says Scott. “It looks so much nicer. It’s just so much better, and you got to stay positive. You’re not going to get everything you want. In the short term it’s a bunch of headache. You know, cause it just seems to go on and on. At times it seems like they just turning up and fixing the same thing over and over again.”

Love Hate Tattoo is one of a few businesses on State Street that’s actually thriving. A new sidewalk was recently added to their side of State Street.

“There’s nothing less inviting then a pile of rubble to walk through, and right now looking down State Street, it’s mostly what you see,” tattoo artist Benton Sillick says.

Sillick is looking forward to the project’s completion.

“You know the noise, the dust. It’s dirty, you know. You don’t know if they’re gonna have to turn off the water,” says Sillick. “One day they hit a gas main. You just don’t know what to expect, and for our customers it make it more difficult for them.”

The work on State Street is expected to be completed at the end of the construction season.","A major street reconstruction project is underway in Rochester, New York, which has caused significant inconvenience and disruption to local businesses and residents.","A photo of a pile of rubble on State Street, with a construction vehicle in the background, and a sign that reads ""State Street Reconstruction Project"" in the foreground."

Since leaving the Black Sea Grain Deal this week, Russia has already struck Ukraine’s grain export ports in Odesa with missile and drone attacks. Some 60,000 tons of grain were destroyed in the attacks.

“Our information indicates that Russia laid additional sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports,” White House National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said in a statement. “We believe that this is a coordinated effort to justify any attacks against civilian ships in the Black Sea and lay blame on Ukraine for these attacks.”

The Russian Defense Ministry has declared international waters in northwestern and southeastern parts of the Black Sea “temporarily dangerous” for shipping. That followed Ukraine’s pledge to continue grain shipments despite the Russian pullout from the deal.

The ministry warned it will see any incoming vessel as laden with military cargo.","The White House warns Russia is preparing for possible attacks on civilian shipping vessels in the Black Sea, amid the suspension of the grain deal.","""Black Sea Grain Deal Suspension: Russia Prepares for Attacks on Shipping Vessels"""

Rangers captured the animal, which was about two-years-old, on Wednesday afternoon following Monday's incident in which Brisbane woman Sarah Peet was chased into the water at Orchid Beach.

Two fellow visitors in a four-wheel-drive rushed to her aid, Sarah and Shane Moffat who punched the dingoes off her, and she was taken to hospital by helicopter with numerous bites.

The lead dingo in a pack of four that attacked a jogger on K'gari has been put down

Brisbane woman Sarah Peet (above) was mauled by a pack of four dingoes on K'gari, formerly Fraser Island, on Monday morning.

Shane and Sarah Moffat rushed into the water when they heard Ms Peet yelling for help

Paramedic Matthew Steer said the woman had been 'corralled and harassed' by the dingoes in the attack.

Shane Moffat said he heard the woman screaming and rushed to help her, acting on instinct.

'We heard her yell help and we both just jumped out of the car ran straight towards her,' he told Today on Thursday.

'She was holding her hands up and two dogs were on both sides of her.'

'I got to the water and pulled one of the dingoes off her and another had just taken off when I got there.'

'The dingo kept going after her as she was walking out of the water and then it launched at me so I had to protect myself.'

A Queensland Department of Environment and Science spokesman said the dingo had been responsible for other recent threatening and biting incidents, including one involving a six-year-old girl.

Taking the 'significant step' to put down the animal was a decision for K'gari's rangers and traditional owners.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing and rangers are attempting to identify the other dingoes involved.

'Should the other animals be identified, we will consider our management options,' the department spokesman said.

The euthanised dingo had been wearing a tracking collar since April, which had allowed Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service rangers to track the animal and its behaviour, as well as monitor human behaviour around it.

When the animal was collared, it weighed more than 17kg, which is heavy for a dingo and a clear indication it had been fed.

The spokesman said it was also clear from its behaviour it had become habituated and had lost its natural wariness, either by being fed or from people interacting with it for videos and selfies.

Environment Minister Leanne Linard acknowledged the difficulty of deciding the future of problem dingoes on K'gari after she arrived on the island on Wednesday.

Euthanising an animal was considered an option of last resort, with the decision made by rangers in consultation with traditional owners, the Butchulla people.

'That would have been a tremendously traumatic experience for that young woman and we all hope that she makes a full recovery,' Ms Linard told reporters on K'gari on Wednesday.

Ms Peet (above) was airlifted to nearby Hervey Bay hospital with as many as 30 bites and a deep laceration on her upper arm

'Decisions in regard to the future of any particular individual dingo ... are made by the people they should be made by, and that's our rangers in conjunction with the traditional owners here on the island.

'It's not something that I involve myself in, but I deeply respect that it is a real balancing act and a difficult one.'

Files are kept on animals that display concerning behaviour as part of detailed incident reporting, the minister said.

A dingo was humanly put down in June after a string of incidents earlier this year including biting a seven-year-old boy and a 42-year-old woman on separate occasions.

'Euthanising a high-risk dingo is a last resort, but this decision is in line with the Fraser Island Dingo Conservation and Risk Management Strategy and part of (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service's) commitment to ensuring the safety of everyone who visits or lives on the island,' the environment department said at the time.

The management of dingoes on the island, communication with visitors and whether anything needs to be done differently were due to be discussed on Wednesday.

While most people do the right thing, there have been examples on social media of people trying to interact with or even pat the animals, Ms Linard said.

'We still have a job to do I think for that small number of people who aren't aware or aren't heeding those messages,' she said.

'We need to keep people safe on this beautiful island, and we need to respect that dingoes are on this island and it's their home as well.

'And I think that important balance is best served by education.'","A 23-year-old woman was mauled by a pack of four dingoes on K'gari, formerly Fraser Island, on Monday morning.

Marc Tessier-Lavigne said in a statement to students and staff that he would step down Aug. 31.

The resignation comes after the board of trustees launched a review in December following allegations he engaged in fraud and other unethical conduct related to his research and papers.

Tessier-Lavigne, a neuroscientist, says he ""never submitted a scientific paper without firmly believing that the data were correct and accurately presented."" But he says he should have been more diligent in seeking corrections regarding his work and he should have operated laboratories with tighter controls.

Panelists found multiple instances of manipulated data in the 12 papers they investigated, but concluded he was not responsible for the misconduct. Still, they found that each of the five papers in which he was principal author ""has serious flaws in the presentation of research data"" and in at least four of them, there was apparent manipulation of data by others.

Tessier-Lavigne said he was aware of issues with four of the five papers but acknowledged taking ""insufficient"" steps to deal with the issues. He said he'll retract three of the papers and correct two.

The papers were published before Tessier-Lavigne became Stanford president.

Misconduct allegations about the work were first aired on PubPeer, a website where members of the scientific community can discuss research papers, the report stated. Questions resurfaced after The Stanford Daily, the university's student-run newspaper, published several stories about the integrity of reports published by his laboratories.

The aggressive reporting merited investigations editor and then-college freshman Theo Baker a special George Polk journalism award. Baker told The Associated Press Wednesday that the retractions and corrections would not have occurred otherwise.

""The fact that we're able to contribute to the scientific record being corrected for five widely cited papers is important,"" he said.

The panel cleared Tessier-Lavigne of the most serious allegations, that a 2009 paper published in the scientific journal Nature was the subject of a fraud investigation and that fraud was found. There was no investigation and no fraud discovered, the panel ruled. The paper proposed a model of neurodegeneration, which could have great potential for Alzheimer’s disease research and therapy, the panel wrote in its report.

But the panel also concluded the paper had multiple problems, including a lack of rigor in its development and that the research that went into the paper and its presentation contained ""various errors and shortcomings.""

The panel did not find evidence that Tessier-Lavigne was aware of the lack of rigor.

""People tend to think of scientists as these individuals that they’ve heard of like Einstein and Marie Curie,"" said H. Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals. ""The truth is that researchers run laboratories filled with people, and everything that happens in that laboratory is a product of many individuals there.""

While the report cleared Tessier-Lavigne of research misconduct, Thorp said ultimately the boss is responsible for what happens in the lab — and shouldn't be distracted by doing other jobs. He pointed to the report's finding that lab culture played a role.

Tessier-Lavigne says he's stepping down because he expects continued debate about his ability to lead the university. He will remain on faculty as a biology professor. He also said he will continue his research into brain development and neurodegeneration.

The board named Richard Saller, a classics professor, as interim president starting Sept. 1, said board chair Jerry Yang.

In a statement, Yang said Tessier-Lavigne was key to creating the university's first new school in 70 years, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, and in 2019, he unveiled a strategic long-range plan that will continue to guide the university's growth.

So-called imposter scams, where a fraudster impersonates someone in order to steal money, are the most common scam in the US, causing Americans to lose $2.6 billion in 2022 alone, the Federal Trade Commission reported.

Debbie Shelton Moore received a six-minute phone call from what she thought was her daughter Lauren, 22, who lives apart from her.

'It just sounded so much like her. It was 100 percent believable,' Moore said. 'Enough to almost give me a heart attack from sheer panic.'

The scam demanded money for the daughter's return - but she was safe the whole time and hadn't been kidnapped.

A Georgia mother became the latest to face a shocking AI phone scam , using her 22-year-old daughter's voice saying she'd been kidnapped and demanding a ransom of $50,000 for her safe return.

Debbie Shelton Moore (pictured right) received what ended up being a six-minute phone call from what she thought was her daughter Lauren (pictured left), 22, who lives apart from her

DailyMail.com previously reported fraudsters can mimic a victim's voice using just a three-second snippet of audio, often stolen from social media profiles.

It is then used to phone a friend or family member convincing them they are in trouble and urgently need money.

Shelton Moore had initially thought Lauren was in a car crash and asking for help until she heard three male voices.

'The man had said, 'Your daughter's been kidnapped and we want $50,000.' Then they had her crying, like, 'Mom, mom' in the background. It was her voice and that's why I was totally freaking out,' she told 11 Alive.

Shelton Moore became more nervous when she checked Lauren's phone location and discovered she was stalled on a highway.

'I [was] thinking she's in the back because he said, 'We have her in the back of the truck.'

Luckily, her husband - who works in cybersecurity - overheard the conversation and sensed something was up. He FaceTimed Lauren, who confirmed she was in no danger and revealing his wife was being scammed.

'It was all just kind of a blur because all I was thinking was, 'How am I going to get my daughter? How in the world are we supposed to get him money?'' she added.

They eventually called the county sheriff's office and they confirmed Lauren's safety.

'My heart is beating and I'm shaking,' she recalled the moment she got the call. 'I'm shaking thinking about it right now.'

The scam is something that has hit a surprising number of Americans. One in four respondents to an April McAfee survey said they had some experience of an AI voice scam and one in ten said they had been targeted personally.

'I'm very well aware of scammers and scams and IRS scams and the fake jury duty,' Moore said. 'But of course, when you hear their voice, you're not going to think clearly and you will panic.'

Police recommend having a 'safe phrase' that you and your family can use to prove they're not artificial.

The rise in accessible and sophisticated AI makes scams quicker and easier to perform, said Steve Grobman, McAfee's chief technology officer.

'One of the things that's most important to recognize with the advances in AI this year is it's largely about bringing these technologies into reach of many more people, including really enabling the scale within the cyberactor community,' Grobman warned.

'Cybercriminals are able to use generative AI for fake voices and deepfakes in ways that used to require a lot more sophistication.'

Vice President Kamala Harris also told CEOs of leading tech companies in May that they have growing moral responsibility to limit the damage to society from their AI products.

Vonny Gamot, head of EMEA at McAfee: 'Advanced artificial intelligence tools are changing the game for cybercriminals. Now, with very little effort, they can clone a person's voice and deceive a close contact into sending money.

'Artificial Intelligence brings incredible opportunities, but with any technology there is always the potential for it to be used maliciously in the wrong hands,' she added.

'This is what we're seeing today with the access and ease of use of AI tools helping cybercriminals to scale their efforts in increasingly convincing ways.'","A mother in Georgia is being scammed by an AI phone scam, where she is convinced her 22-year-old daughter is kidnapped and demands a ransom of $50,000.","A mother is convinced her 22-year-old daughter is kidnapped and demands a ransom of $50,000 in an AI phone scam."

The mood across trading floors has been generally positive of late, with last week's news that US inflation had slowed more than expected coming alongside healthy data suggesting a recession could also be avoided.

Sentiment was further boosted this week by data showing UK inflation cooling more than expected.

The figures have fanned hopes that the long-running campaign of rate hikes was kicking in and policymakers in Washington and London could tap the brakes.

Comments from a top European Central Bank official this week indicated a similar outlook in Frankfurt.

The Fed is tipped to lift rates at its meeting next week but expectations are that it will stop after that, although there is still debate about whether it will announce another later in the year.

""With inflation easing and odds for a soft landing rising, investors may adopt an 'it could have been worse mood',"" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.

""Perhaps it's unlikely risk sentiment will drift too far askew, especially given the less hawkish implications the global inflation reset will have on central bank interest rates.""

Asian stock markets began Thursday on the front foot but many lost momentum as the day went on.

Europe's main equity indices were higher approaching the half-way mark.

On Wall Street Wednesday, the Dow chalked up an eighth-straight advance, though disappointing earnings from tech titans Netflix and Tesla after the market closed dented sentiment.

A lot of the unease on trading floors is centred on China's troubled economy, with the recovery from years of zero-Covid policies appearing to have shuddered to a halt, with the threat of deflation lingering.

A report earlier this week showed growth came in a lot lower than expected owing to a drop in consumer activity and following figures pointing to weak demand for the country's goods overseas.

And investors are growing anxious for Beijing to implement measures to reinvigorate growth, with very little concrete coming out so far, apart from some small interest rate moves and pledges to aid the property sector.

""Let’s be clear: affirmative action still exists for white people. It’s called legacy admissions,"" Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, said on Twitter.

""Now more than ever, there’s no justification for allowing this process to continue,"" said Viet Nguyen, a graduate of Brown and Harvard who leads Ed Mobilizer, a nonprofit that has fought legacy preferences since 2018, in an article published by the Associated Press. ""No other country in the world does legacy preferences. Now is a chance to catch up with the rest of the world.""

According to the AP, critics of legacy admissions also exist within the political right, with at least one Republican Party politician, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, calling for an end to legacy admissions. Sen. Scott is running for the GOP presidential nomination in the 2024 presidential election.

Here's what you should know about legacy admissions, and the controversy surrounding it.

What are legacy admissions?

According to a 2022 article published by the AP, legacy admissions, also known as legacy preferences, refers to a decades-old tradition of giving college applicants who are the children of an alumnus or alumni of the same school a boost in their application.

Historians, according to the AP, have traced legacy preference to the 1920s as elite colleges sought to limit the number of Jewish students. It continued for decades at a time when the vast majority of college students in the U.S. were white men.

What schools have legacy admissions?

According to the AP, most schools are not required to disclose how many legacy students they enroll, and many keep it private.

In the 2018 Survey of College and University Admissions Directors, which was conducted by the website Inside Higher Ed, in collaboration with Gallup, figures show that 42% of admissions directors at private colleges and universities said that legacy status is a factor in admissions decisions at their school. The figure for admissions directors at public institution is 6%.

In a 2022 report issued by think tank Education Reform Now, it is stated that the use of legacy preferences is more common among private colleges, and is especially prevalent in the Northeast. Legacy preferences in public universities are less common, and concentrated on the East Coast.

What's the impact of legacy admissions?

In a 2018 report issued by Education Reform Now, it is claimed that the odds of admission for legacy students are three times that of their counterparts.

According to a 2022 report issued by the same organization, figures from a 1997 study estimated that applying as a legacy student gives the applicant the equivalent advantage of earning an additional 160 points on the SAT.

How many students are admitted as part of legacy admissions?

The AP has reported that based on reports by the University of Southern California, 14% of 2022's admitted USC students had family ties to alumni or donors. Stanford reported a similar rate.

Both USC and Stanford are located in California, where state law requires schools to disclose the practice of legacy admissions.

In 2022, the AP reported that based on basic data they received from eight of the country's 30 most selective colleges, the share of legacy students in that year's freshman class averaged 12% for the eight schools.

Meanwhile, according to a report issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2019, over 43% of white students admitted at Harvard are considered to be in a category the report called ""athletes, legacies, those on the dean's interest list, and children of faculty and staff"" (ALDC).

How could legacy admissions affect students of color?

According to the AP, critics of legacy admissions say it contributes to persistently low numbers of Black students at top colleges. In addition, at many schools with legacy preferences, Black students were not admitted until the 1960s, said Michael Dannenberg, a vice president at the Education Reform Now think tank.

""White applicants have between eight and 16 generations of ancestors on which to establish an alumni connection,"" said Dannenberg, who has opposed the practice since he was an aide to Sen. Ted Kennedy, the late Massachusetts Democrat, two decades ago. ""For the vast majority of Black and Latino applicants, there’s maybe one or two generations.""

The report by NBER also states that for many of the white Harvard students who were admitted as ALDCs, they might not have been accepted to the school if they were treated like other applicants.

""Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs,"" read a portion of the NBER report. ""Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.""

What's the argument for legacy admissions?

According to the AP, supporters of the policy say it builds an alumni community, and encourages donations.

Are there schools that have ended legacy admissions?

Yes.

In 2020, Johns Hopkins University announced the university will end legacy preference in admissions.

""Serving as an engine of social mobility is core to our mission,"" said the university's Vice Provost for Admissions and Financial Aid, David Phillips, in the statement.

A year later, Amherst College announced that it will end legacy preferences.

""Now is the time to end this historic program that inadvertently limits educational opportunity by granting a preference to those whose parents are graduates of the College,"" said Biddy Martin, president of Amherst College, in a statement.

Amherst and Johns Hopkins were among the 28 schools listed in Education Reform Now's 2022 report as having ended legacy preferences since 2015. Other schools on the list include the California Institute of Technology, Florida State University, Pomona College, University of Florida, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.

On July 19, 2023, after the Supreme Court ruling on Affirmative Action, officials with Wesleyan University, which is located in Connecticut, announced that the school will end legacy admissions.

""By recruiting students, faculty and staff with diverse life experiences, attributes, and points of view, we continue to build a diverse, energetic learning environment comprised of people who think critically and creatively and who value independence of mind and generosity of spirit,"" read a portion of the statement.

Have government officials taken action on legacy admissions?

In 2021, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed into a law a bill that bans state-supported higher education institutions from using legacy preferences.

In 2022, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman of New York introduced a bill that would ban ""institutions that participate in federal student aid programs from admitting students based on family ties.""

The bill, according to Congress's website, was referred to a legislative committee, but no further actions were taken.

What do people think about legacy admissions?

According to 2021 survey conducted by Inside Higher Ed and College Pulse and presented by Kaplan, 54% of the over 2,000 college students surveyed say they strongly support ending legacy admissions, while 25% say they somewhat support it.","Affirmative action, also known as legacy admissions, is a system that some argue gives preference to students from families with alumni or donors. Critics argue it limits opportunities for students of color and perpetuates racial disparities in higher education.","A photo of a diverse group of students, with a white student at the center, looking out at the camera with a mix of determination and frustration."

Most services are expected to run between 7am and 7pm, but some stations - namely Plumpton and Cooksbridge, will be closed due to the walkout.

Trains that do operate are expected to be very busy, with some passengers not able to board their usual train.

Strike action will also take place on Saturday, July 22 and next week.

Chris Fowler, head of network operations for Govia Thameslink Railway - which runs Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services, said: “We are really sorry about the impact that this round of industrial action will have on our customers, especially as many will be looking to start their summer holidays.

“Where possible, we’re running as many trains as we can, but unfortunately there will be some days and times when people will be left without a service.

“It’s incredibly important that people check every journey they plan to make before they travel and leave plenty of time, as our services will be much busier during this period.”

The first train services today will leave Brighton significantly later than normal. The first service to London Bridge will depart at 7.16am, with the first train to London Victoria leaving at 7.29am. The first train to Hove won't leave until 7.58am.

The last service from Hove to Brighton will leave much earlier than usual at 6.35pm, with services from London Bridge and London Victoria departing for Brighton at 8.35pm and 8.50pm respectively.

Due to the disruption, non-stop Gatwick Express services between London Victoria, Gatwick Airport and Brighton will not operate.

Extra stops at Clapham Junction and East Croydon have been added to Southern services to and from the airport to help customers.

Gatwick Express tickets are being accepted on Southern and Thameslink services at no additional cost.

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said the strike action would show the country “just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry”.

He said: “My team of negotiators and I are available 24/7 for talks with the train operating companies and government.

“Yet quite incredibly neither party has made any attempt whatsoever to arrange any meetings or put forward a decent offer that can help us reach a negotiated solution.

“The government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.”","The UK rail network is set to be disrupted by a strike action by the RMT union, which will affect services on the Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express routes.","You are a news assistant.

Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul are at one of their lowest points ever, with diplomacy stalled and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calling for increased weapons development, including tactical nukes. In response, President Yoon Suk Yeol has pulled South Korea closer to long-standing ally Washington, and even sought to bury the hatchet with former colonial power Japan in a bid to contain North Korea. In April, Seoul and Washington said that if Pyongyang ever used its nuclear weapons against the allies, it would face a nuclear reaction and the end of its regime. The Korea-US-Japan trilateral summit is scheduled to be held in the United States in August, Seoul's presidential office said Thursday, adding the specific date and location would be announced later. The Yonhap News Agency reported the meeting will take place on August 18 atÂ Camp David near Washington, citing unnamed sources. The announcement comes days after Seoul and Washington held their first Nuclear Consultative Group meeting in the South Korean capital. On Tuesday, a nuclear-armed American submarine made a port visit to Busan for the first time since 1981. Pyongyang last week said it had successfully tested the Hwasong-18, its new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile, for the second time. Analysts say the tests represent a major breakthrough for North Korea's banned weapons programmes. The announcement also comes as Washington confirmed Tuesday that a US soldier -- who had been jailed in the South on assault charges -- is believed to have been detained by North Korea after crossing the border. Pyongyang has a long history of detaining Americans and using them as bargaining chips.","the us, south korea, and japan are increasing military cooperation to counter north korea's growing nuclear threats. relations between pyongyang and seoul are at an all-time low, with north korea calling for increased weapons development, including tactical nukes. the korea-us-japan trilateral summit is scheduled to be held in the us in august.","a photo of the us, south korea, and japan holding hands, with a north korean missile in the background."

Devastated, she searched for divers who could help her, and came across Michael Pelley, better known as “Merman Mike,” who is famous for documenting his journeys retrieving people’s lost belongings underwater.

“It’s very sentimental to me — we’ve been married for 10 years,” Jennie said in a July 10 video posted to Pelley’s YouTube channel.

Pelley dove into the murky green waters, where it was clear just how unclear his view was with his camera in tow.

“Almost immediately after I reached the bottom of the lake, I realized how difficult the search was going to be,” Pelley wrote in the caption of the YouTube video. “The silt had immediately clouded out the area and I was in almost zero visibility.”

He continued: “After a while of searching I knew I had to go back up to the surface and come up with a better plan, but unlike my normal dives, I wasn't able to just slowly ascend to the surface.""

Bass Lake is man-made and the area Pelley was searching required him to go deep, about 45 miles deep. Pelley said he had to do 3-minute safety stops after swimming 15 feet.

Pelley dove down at least twice during his search and swam back underwater. He removed his glove and searched with his hand, feeling his way through the bottom in order to have a better chance at finding the ring.

""After pulling a couple of sticks and cans out of the thick silt, I finally pulled out what I thought was going to be another bottle top or pull tab, but instead I was looking at a giant diamond,"" Pelley said. ""It was the wedding ring!""

""I was beyond excited, especially because I knew how slim the odds of me actually finding it were,"" he said.

On the screen of the video, Pelley described how a “huge surge of adrenaline"" required him to steady his hands and prepare for the 3-minute safety stop.

There were cheers of joy from Jennie, her friends and family when Pelley finally emerged from the lake.

“I can’t believe it, that’s awesome,” Jennie remarked, clapping and repeatedly thanking Pelley. He jokingly responded, “Trust me, after seeing the bottom, I almost can’t believe it.”

Under the video, which has garnered nearly 14,000 views, Jennie expressed her gratitude once again, commenting: “Sooo amazing! You guys rock! I can’t believe you found it under that dark water. I’m so appreciative! Forever grateful ❤️.”

He also shared the happy news on Instagram, calling it his ""deepest dive yet.""

“You can’t just go for the treasure, you have to go for the trash too,” he said in the video.

In the caption, Pelley says he found sunglasses and a broken phone, but the true highlight of his day was finding Jennie's ring and to get it back to her.

“I couldn't be more happy about the outcome,” he said.
