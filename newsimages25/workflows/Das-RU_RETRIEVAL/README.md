**MediaEval2025_NewsImage_Das-RU_RET**

This project is developed for the MediaEval 2025 NewsImages challenge, focusing on the image retrieval subtask.

This method uses the Long-CLIP model to make use of longer pieces of text, including the first sentences of the articles to create a better fit.

To retrieve the article text I used the newspaper3k python package https://pypi.org/project/newspaper3k/

I also finetune the model according to a method from Song, Rui, et al. (https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/15/3098). This method consists of adding an extra label predictor to learn the relationship between text and news categories like 'economy' or 'science' from datasets the n24 news dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritabrata123/n24news-zip
) and then project the embeddings through this 'label alignment module'. In this paper it was shown that this class aware embedding showed more consistent retrieval results. The method use three different loss components, the contrastive loss between text and corresponding image embedding, the label loss, and then a KL divergence loss between the new embeddings and original embeddings, which makes sure the embeddings generated by the model arenâ€™t too different from the original embeddings generated by CLIP. For my approach I only fine-tuned the text encoder, so I could re-use the image embeddings of the standard longclip model for efficiency. 

After encoding the yfcc100m dataset with the longclip model, FAISS is used to compare three types of embeddings (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). Firstly the embeddings from the fine-tuned label aligned model ('sec' for news-section), secondly embeddings from the standard longclip model that just uses headlines ('reg'), and thirdly embeddings from the standard longclip model based on headlines + text to fully utilize the capablities of the longclip model ('longtext').
