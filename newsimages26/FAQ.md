## Your Paper Submission

* For the challenge, we accept only open-source, fully reproducible solutions. No online services. The workflow must run locally.
* “Quest for Insight” submissions can use any resources. However, they are not able to take part in the challenge itself (no place on the leaderboard, so submission of runs).
* We want to keep a broad scope and welcome all types of contributions (put that on the website). We encourage people to participate in the event even if they do not have a technical background.
