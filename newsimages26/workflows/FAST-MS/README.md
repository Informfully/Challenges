# NewsImages Challenge Submission

## Group Information

## Overview

This repository contains our submission for the NewsImages Challenge (MediaEval 2026). The objective of the challenge is to recommend or generate a relevant image for a given news article title.

Our approach combines both **image retrieval** and **text-to-image generation** methodologies to maximize performance across diverse article types, including current events, historical archives, political news, health-related articles, and abstract concepts.

We developed and evaluated multiple retrieval and generation pipelines and submitted a set of complementary runs to capture both factual grounding and generative creativity.

## Methodology

Our solution consists of two primary components:

1. **Retrieval-Based Image Recommendation**
2. **Generative Image Synthesis**

## Retrieval-Based Approaches

Retrieval-based methods recommend an existing image from the provided training dataset by computing similarity between article titles and associated images.

### 1. Official Retrieval Baseline

The organizer-provided baseline approach was used as a reference point for benchmarking our improvements.

### 2. Hybrid Retrieval

A weighted combination of:

- CLIP image-text similarity
- BGE semantic embeddings
- TF-IDF lexical similarity

### 3. Entity-Enhanced Hybrid Retrieval (Primary Submission)

Our strongest retrieval system extends the hybrid model by incorporating named entity overlap extracted using spaCy.

Components

- OpenCLIP ViT-L-14
- BAAI BGE Base EN v1.5
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- spaCy Named Entity Recognition

Weighted Fusion

- CLIP Similarity: 25%
- BGE Semantic Similarity: 45%
- TF-IDF Similarity: 10%
- Named Entity Overlap: 20%

### 4. MPNet Semantic Retrieval

Dense semantic retrieval using the Sentence Transformers `all-mpnet-base-v2` model.

## Generative Approaches

### 1. FLUX

Images generated using FLUX.1 Schnell.

### 2. RealVisXL

Images generated using RealVisXL V5.0.
